# schema-stitching-bugs

This demo shows how `mergeSchemas` breaks the recursive nature of resolvers:
if a new field is added that should resolve to an object type, none of that
object typeâ€™s pre-existing resolvers will be called. For some reason, the
resolver for the new field is expected to return an object with object-resolved
values for each field.
